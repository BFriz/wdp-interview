# WDP Interview Assignment

Welcome to the admissions process for Web Development Program (WDP) at RED Academy! 
  
We would love to learn more about you and your interest in programming. In order to be successful in WDP, you have to enjoy programming, and the way to truly know is for you is to try it. If you are passionate and committed to becoming a developer, the tight-knit family at RED will help guide you along that path. 

Please follow the steps below before your interview, where we will then chat about your work.
 1. Download atom ([click here](https://atom.io/)) this text editor is what we will use for your tutorials and how you will complete your assignment
 2. Next head over to Node.js and download the relevant package. Node.js is a dependency for running our turtorials - CODEROAD. (a dependency is exactly what it sounds like CODEROAD depends on Node.js to run. Think oxygen is a dependency for humans)
 3. Finally head over to [CODEROAD](https://coderoad.github.io/) and following the instructions to getting everything up and running.

In this assignment we are NOT testing your programming aptitude, instead we want to see how you approach a problem and your resourcefulness. Do not worry if you are new and don't have the most advanced or polished site in the world. During your interview we will be asking about what you tried and learned along the way. Feel free to go above and beyond what you learned in the chapters and impress us! Also try to get through the whole admissions assignment on your own (google is a fine resource).

The second part of the interview process is to take two typing tests that you can find below. Typing Code is different to the typing which you know and love, you will be using a lot more !${[;)?>. So it is important for us to gauge your ability going into the course. Please complete the following 2 exercises and include your scores when you send over your website:

1. Standard Typing Test - [10 fast fingers](http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english)
2. Code Typing Test - [Typing.io](https://typing.io/) - Just the first exercise here and don't worry about understanding the code you will be typing as this will all make sense once you have started the program.*


Good luck and feel free to reach out with any further questions that you have!
