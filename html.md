# HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Mark-Up Language. HTML is a language we use to **structure** our webpage. Before we get into writing out some HTML we are going to set-up Codepen. 

We will be using Codepen to create our website. You can visit codepen by clicking **[here](http://codepen.io/pen/?editors=1100#0)** 

***"CodePen is a playground for the front end side of the web. It's all about inspiration, education, and sharing."***

We will be using codepen as a sandpit to create and learn without wasting time with set-up. Codepen is a lot more lenient than an actual environment - keep this in mind as we move forward. 

Let's try writing some HTML in the HTML tab on Codepen. Write out the below code.

```
<h1>This is a headings element</h1>
<p>While this is a paragraph element</p>
```

...nice. Hopefully you saw something pop up on your page. Each one of these elements has an ```<opening tag>``` and a ```</closing tag>```. The ```/``` denotes the closing of your element. There are many different types of elements and luckily the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) has a list of them and their uses and it can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

Spend some time using some different html elements and writing them out. Why do you think there are different named elements?

One you should focus on are **header**, **nav**, **article**, **section**, **aside**.

Now we also can **nest** element inside one of another.
```
<section>
  <p>One Fish</p>
  <p>Two Fish</p>
</section>
```
Both paragraph elements are children of the section element. Why we do this will become more apparent once we start using ***CSS***.
